            <p>The Great Irish Potato Famine, also known as the Great Hunger, was a period of mass starvation and disease in Ireland from 1845 to 1852. The famine was caused by the failure of the potato crop, which was the staple food of the Irish population at the time.</p>
            <p>Due to a potato blight, known as <em>Phytophthora infestans</em>, the potato crops across Ireland were devastated. The blight destroyed the leaves and edible tubers of the potato plants, leading to widespread crop failure.</p>
            <p>During the famine years, approximately one million people died from starvation or disease, and another one million emigrated from Ireland to escape the devastating conditions. The famine had profound social, economic, and political impacts on Ireland, leading to a decline in population, land reforms, and increased Irish nationalism.</p>

        <h2>Causes of the Famine</h2>
        <p>The primary cause of the Great Irish Potato Famine was the potato blight, a disease that destroyed the potato crops across Ireland. The blight was caused by a fungus-like organism called <em>Phytophthora infestans</em>, which thrived in the damp Irish climate.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the socio-political factors exacerbated the effects of the famine. The British government's inadequate response to the crisis, coupled with policies such as absentee landlordism and the export of food from Ireland, worsened the suffering of the Irish population.</p>
        <h2>Impact of the Famine</h2>
        <p>The Great Irish Potato Famine had devastating consequences for Ireland. The loss of the potato crop, which was the main food source for the majority of the population, led to widespread starvation and disease.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the famine caused mass emigration from Ireland, as people sought refuge in other countries, particularly the United States and Canada. This wave of emigration had long-term demographic and cultural effects on Ireland and its diaspora.</p>
        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>The Great Irish Potato Famine left a lasting legacy on Ireland and its people. It highlighted the vulnerabilities of Ireland's agricultural economy and exposed the injustices of British colonial rule.</p>
        <p>The famine also contributed to the growth of Irish nationalism and calls for land reform and home rule. The memory of the famine continues to shape Irish identity and influence debates on issues such as poverty, hunger, and social justice.</p>
